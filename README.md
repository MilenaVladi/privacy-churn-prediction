# Bachelor Thesis: Privacy Concerns and Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and code for my bachelor thesis on **customer churn intention in online services**, with a focus on **privacy, trust, anonymity, coping strategies, and emotions** as predictors.

## üìñ Thesis Overview
Unlike traditional churn research that relies mainly on behavioral or transactional data, this study analyzed **self-reported survey data (N = 307 respondents)** to capture users‚Äô perceptions and attitudes.

### Methods
- **Clustering analysis**: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering  
- **Cluster validation**: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Gap Statistic  
- **Predictive modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)  

### Key Findings
- **Best predictive model**: XGBoost (F1 = 0.585, ROC-AUC = 0.701)  
- Strongest churn predictors: **privacy tools usage, positive emotions, false information sharing, age, privacy invasion**  
- Identified three user clusters:  
  1. Pragmatic users ‚Äì low privacy concern, moderate churn risk  
  2. Concerned copers ‚Äì high privacy invasion, active coping strategies, moderate churn risk  
  3. Empowered leavers ‚Äì high tool usage and discontinuation intentions, strongest churn risk
